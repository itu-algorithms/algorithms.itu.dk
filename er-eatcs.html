<p>EATCS council statement, Eva Rotenberg</p>

<p>Mini-bio: I am a professor at the IT University of Copenhagen, Denmark. 
  I work on algorithmic problems relating to graphs
  and geometry. <a href="https://algorithms.itu.dk/erot.html">My
    home page</a> has slightly more information. </p>

<p> Thank you for the nomination. I would be happy to contribute to
  the organisation of eacts, and to work towards improving the already
  high-quality scientific environment of theoretical computer science
  in Europe. I have been very active in the last year of EATCS, and 
  I have enjoyed being part of the following initiatives: 

<ul>
  <li>Revisiting awards to increase transparency and diversity in the set of potential nominees.</li>
  <li>Co-locating EATCS-associated conferences (in this case, ICALP) with other conferences, when it (1) makes sense to the community and (2) is logistically feasible. <br/> 
    The purpose is twofold: to reduce the travel-related carbon impact to the benefit of our global environment, and, <br/> 
    to bring communities together for the benefit of our scientific environment.</li>
  <li>Working towards better coordination with conferences abroad. E.g. coordinating the SODA deadline with the dates for ICALP.</li></ul>

  On the first two accounts, we had some success. We rephrased the criteria for the Presburger Award to take PhD age and leaves of absense into account, and we plan to co-locate Icalp with PodC/Spaa next year.<br/> 

  On all accounts, there is still work to be done.</p>

  <p>Here are some additional 
  things I find important. 
  <ul>
    <li>We, as a community, should be kind, supportive, and encouraging,
  especially towards junior researchers. <!--/li-->
<ul><li>Conferences, workshops, summer schools, and tutorials are
  important venues for junior researchers to expand their scientific
  horizon and meet other researchers, and we should (continue to)
  support any and all efforts to provide such venues.</li>
<li>The theoretical computer science community should (continue to) be
  an inclusive and safe place for everyone.</li> 
<li>Feed-back from peer review should (continue to) be polite,
  and, when possible, constructive. </li></ul>
 <li> We should continue
      the efforts to attract and maintain high-quality conferences in
      Europe. 
    </li>
    <li>Open access is better than closed. </li>
    <li>EATCS should continue its good collaboration with the EATCS-associated conferences.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>All in all, I would be happy to continue the good work in the council, and I would look
  forward to work together with the many excellent other council members.</p>
