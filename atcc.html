    <h1>PhD Course at ITU: Advanced Topics in Computational Complexity. </h1>
    <P>This PhD Course (awaiting approval) is taught by the <a href="https://algorithms.itu.dk/">Algorithms and Complexity group of ITU</a> and friends.</P>
    <P>We plan to cover topics such as e.g. the following:
    <ul><li>Fine-grained complexity</li>
      <li>Algebraic complexity</li>
      <li>Existential theory of the reals</li>
      <li>Fragile complexity</li>
      <li>Proof complexity</li>
      <li>Parameterised complexity</li>
      <li>Sigma two completeness</li></ul>
     </P>
    <p>We are hoping to meet every second week, likely Fridays, starting 10:15, at ITU.<br/>
    These times are chosen to comfortably fit the 08:00 train from Odense and the 08:50 train from Lund.<br/>
    Daily schedule will be: <ul><li>10 AM to noon: Theme 1</li><li>noon to 1pm: Lunch break </li>
      <li>1pm to 3pm: Theme 2</li><li>3 pm: cake break </li><li>Finally: Continued discussions either together or in groups, inspired by today's topics.</li></ul>
    </p>
    <p>Who can sign up:
    <ul><li>Prerequisites: mathematical maturity, knowledge of computational complexity.</li>
    <li>Any PhD student of computer science, mathematics, and quantum information theory can join.</li>
    <li>In case of doubt, or in case you are not a PhD student, you must contact the course organisers to enroll. Include a transcript of passed courses and projects in your mail.</li></ul></p>
    <p>How to sign up:
    Contact the course organisers, Eva Rotenberg <erot@itu.dk> and Ivor van der Hoog <ivva@itu.dk> </p>
